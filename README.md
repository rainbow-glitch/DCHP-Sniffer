This is a simple project based of off a video i found by Kalle Hallden
I went to his github project but nothing worked so i decided to make my own version that works pretty similar.

His github project: https://github.com/KalleHallden/reddit_automations

## It's super simple to set up. If somebody wants a version that uses 'Pushbullet' to notify your phone create a Issue saying that and I will gladly release it
