Sniffs DCHP packets to detect when a set ip connects to your network

This is a simple project based of off a video i found by Kalle Hallden
I went to his github project but nothing worked so i decided to make my own version that works pretty similar.

His github project: https://github.com/KalleHallden/reddit_automations

## It's super simple to set up. If somebody wants a version that uses 'Pushbullet' to notify your phone create a Issue saying that and I will gladly release it

If you need any help open an issue and i will respond as soon as I am able to
